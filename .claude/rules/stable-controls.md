# Stable controls

UI changes follow [docs/ux.md → Stable controls](../../docs/ux.md#stable-controls):

- A click never changes what is under the cursor; clicking the same spot again does the same thing again.
- Lists and pickers keep their order while open; toggling an item changes only its box or switch.
- Toggles keep their size (state by color, not by an added icon); optional buttons keep their slot.
- What appears fades in; what moves glides (`useGlide`); folding into "…" follows the window width only.

Before finishing a UI change, click every new or changed control twice in the debug app and check that
nothing beside it moved.
